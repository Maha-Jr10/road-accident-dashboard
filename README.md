# 🚦 UK Road Safety Dashboard (2021–2022)

## 📖 Project Overview

How do you turn 300,000+ rows of raw traffic collision data into life-saving insights? This project addresses that challenge by providing a comprehensive, interactive dashboard designed for stakeholders like the **Department for Transport**, local police forces, and urban planners.

Using data from 2021 and 2022, this dashboard identifies patterns in road accidents to help authorities prioritize safety interventions and resource allocation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

* **Tool:** Microsoft Excel (Advanced)
* **Data Processing:** Power Query (ETL - Cleaning, Merging, and Formatting)
* **Analysis:** Pivot Tables, DAX-style Calculated Measures
* **Visualization:** Dynamic Charts, Slicers, Timeline Filters, and Custom Iconography

## 📊 Key Insights & Features

### 🔑 Primary KPIs

* **Total Casualties:** 417,883 recorded over two years.
* **Severity Analysis:** Breakdown of Fatal (1.7%), Serious (14.2%), and Slight (84.1%) casualties.
* **Vehicle Performance:** Identification of high-risk vehicle types (Cars account for ~80% of casualties).

### 📈 Secondary Metrics

* **YoY Monthly Trends:** A direct comparison between 2021 and 2022 to identify seasonal spikes.
* **Environmental Factors:** Analysis of Road Surface conditions (Dry vs. Wet/Ice) and Light conditions (Daylight vs. Dark).
* **Infrastructure Impact:** Casualties categorized by Road Type (Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Roundabouts, etc.).
* **Geographic Distribution:** Comparison of Urban vs. Rural accident density.

## 📂 Dataset Details

* **Data Source:** UK Department for Transport (Raw Collision Data)
* **Volume:** 307,973 rows × 23 columns
* **Time Period:** January 2021 – December 2022

## 🚀 How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Filters:** Use the "Filter Panels" on the right to toggle between **Rural** and **Urban** data.
2. **Timeline:** Use the "Accident Date" slicer to drill down into specific months or years.
3. **Interactivity:** Click on specific charts to see how metrics cross-reference (e.g., viewing Fatalities specifically for "Wet" road surfaces).

## 💡 Why This Matters

By transforming raw, overwhelming data into a visual story, this project empowers decision-makers to:

* Identify high-risk road types for infrastructure upgrades.
* Optimize emergency response deployment based on urban/rural trends.
* Develop public safety campaigns targeting specific vehicle types or conditions.

### 💡 Pro-Tips for your GitHub Repo:

1. **Add the File:** Make sure to upload the actual `.xlsx` file (or a zipped version if it's too large) so people can download and test the interactivity.
2. **Add a "Lessons Learned" section:** Mentioning challenges you faced with Power Query or how you chose the color palette adds a great personal touch for recruiters.
3. **Video Link:** Since you mentioned a walkthrough video in your post, embed that link directly in the README under a "Video Demo" heading!

**Would you like me to help you write a technical "How-To" section explaining the specific Power Query steps you took to clean the data?**
